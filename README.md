A PHP Debugger interface using XDebug and WebKit's WebInspector

I always have though that WebInspector is a great graphical debugging interface. Since PHP is so highly deployed I though
it could make a great combination to use it to debug PHP. 
FirePHP and ChromePHP try to bridge the gap between WebInspector and PHP but neither allow you to step thru the code
or inspect variables. This development does exactly that.

It has been develop thanks to the following great open-source projects:
 - XDebug: http://www.xdebug.org
 - NodeJS: http://www.nodejs.org
 - HaXe: http://www.haxe.org
